# Music Genre Classification
Website where user can record audio or upload pre-existing audio file in order to know the genre of the music.

For audio and music feature extraction for machine learning purposes, usually mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) are extracted from the song or audio. These features are used to train the model.
TensorFlow: Machine learning software library.
Librosa: Speech processing library to extract features from songs.
NumPy: Mathematical model for scientific computing.
Scikit-learn (formerly scikits.learn and also known as sklearn): Another machine learning model (we’ll use this library to split training and testing data).
JSON: Used to “jsonify” the dataset (explained in the next section).
